Ternary Operator in JavaScript
The ternary operator in JavaScript, also known as the conditional operator, is a handy tool for writing concise conditional statements. It takes three operands:

Condition: An expression that evaluates to true or false.
Expression if true: The expression to be evaluated if the condition is true.
Expression if false: The expression to be evaluated if the condition is false.

Here's the syntax:

JavaScript
condition ? expression_if_true : expression_if_false

The entire operator evaluates to either the expression_if_true or the expression_if_false depending on the outcome of the condition.

Checking Even or Odd with Ternary Operator
Here's how to use the ternary operator to check if a number is even or odd in JavaScript:

JavaScript
let num = 10;

 Check if number is even using modulo operator and ternary operator
let evenOdd = num % 2 === 0 ? "Even" : "Odd";

console.log(`${num} is ${evenOdd}`);


This code outputs:

10 is Even

Advantages of using Ternary Operator
The ternary operator offers several benefits:

Conciseness: Makes code more concise and readable compared to if-else statements for simple conditions.
Inline evaluation: Allows for inline evaluation of expressions, which can be useful in certain situations.
However, remember:

Readability: Overusing the ternary operator for complex conditions can make code less readable.
Nesting: Nesting ternary operators can become difficult to follow.
Choose the approach that best suits the clarity and maintainability of your code.
